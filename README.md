**Road Accident Dynamic Dashboard Project**
Situation:
Analyzed road accident data from the UK (2021â€“2022) to uncover key factors contributing to accidents and develop insights to minimize casualties. The project aimed to identify trends and create strategies to reduce accidents.

Task:
The goal was to generate actionable insights that could inform safety policies and reduce road accidents by understanding casualty patterns and contributing factors.

Action:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Conducted complete data preparation and cleaning using MS Excel.
Analysis: Performed advanced data analysis on accident severity, vehicle type, road conditions, and accident time (day/night).
Visualization: Created visualizations to compare monthly trends, vehicle type casualties, road types, and day/night accidents.

Results:
Key Metrics: Total casualties, accident severity breakdown, casualties by vehicle type, and casualty distribution across urban vs. rural areas.

Insights:
Casualties: Fatality rate was 2%, with 84% of accidents resulting in slight injuries.
Vehicle Type: 80% of casualties involved cars.
Location: 61% of accidents occurred in urban areas, with 39% in rural areas.
Timing: 73% of accidents occurred during daylight, while 27% happened at night.
Road Type: 74% of accidents occurred on single carriageway roads.
Road Surface: 65% of accidents took place on dry road surfaces.
Identified a reduction in casualties from the previous year.

Impact:
Provided data-driven insights to guide policy decisions aimed at reducing accidents, with a focus on vehicle types, road conditions, and time-of-day factors.

Skills Utilized:
Data Preparation and Cleaning (Excel)
Advanced Data Analysis and Insights Generation
Data Visualization and Dashboard Development
Trend Analysis

Outcome:
The project demonstrated the ability to identify key factors affecting road safety and provided insights that could inform policies and strategies for reducing accidents.
