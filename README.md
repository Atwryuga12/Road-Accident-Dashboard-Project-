**Road Accident Dynamic Dashboard Project**
This project showcases a dynamic dashboard built using Microsoft Excel to analyze fictional data on road accidents in the UK for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard is intended for educational purposes, focusing on data visualization techniques and insights into accident patterns.

**Key Features:**
Total Casualties: A comprehensive overview of casualties, including the total count and a detailed breakdown by accident severity.
Accident Severity Analysis: Percentage distribution of casualties categorized by accident severity (e.g., slight, serious, fatal).
Vehicle Type Analysis: Identification of the vehicle types associated with the highest number of casualties, highlighting the most at-risk categories.
Casualties by Vehicle Type: A detailed comparison of casualties across different vehicle types.
Monthly Trends: Year-over-year comparison of casualty trends, highlighting seasonal variations and patterns for both 2021 and 2022.
Casualties by Road Type: Insights into the number of casualties based on different road types (e.g., highways, residential roads).
Road Surface Condition: Examination of how road surface conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy) impact the casualty rates.
Casualties by Area/Location & Day/Night Comparison: Analysis of how location (urban vs. rural) and time of day (day vs. night) affect casualty numbers.
Purpose:
The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis and dashboard creation using Excel, helping to visualize and interpret accident data effectively. By exploring various key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, the dashboard offers a clear, actionable view of road accident data for decision-makers or educational use.
